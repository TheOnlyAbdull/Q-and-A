    Text Color:
    For most of the text content, you can use black (#212121) or a slightly lighter shade like dark blue (#1976D2) for better legibility. Use white (#FFFFFF) for text that needs to stand out on a dark background.
    
    Navigation Bar (Nav) Color:
    You can use the main color (#2196F3) for the background of the navigation bar to make it prominent. For the text or icons within the navigation bar, use white (#FFFFFF) for good contrast.
    
    Button Color:
    Use the accent colors from the palette, such as deep blue (#1976D2) or sky blue (#64B5F6), for button backgrounds. Ensure that the button text color provides enough contrast against the chosen background color. For example, if the button background is deep blue, use white (#FFFFFF) for the text color.
    
    Background Color:
    You can opt for a light blue shade (#E3F2FD) as the background color of your web application to create a fresh and clean look. Ensure that the text and other elements on this background have sufficient contrast for readability.
